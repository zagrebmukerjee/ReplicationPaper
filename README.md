Catherine Darin and Zagreb Mukerjee

To generate the tables and figures in our final PDF:
1) Clone or download this repository to a folder. 
2) Create an empty /data directory. 
3) Run 'main.R' (after installing appropriate packages). 
- This will pull data from the Census - it may take a long time. 
- It will clean and process the data, and store it in the data folder. 
4) Run replicateRegsAndExtend_short v2.R. This will create the estimates used in the paper. 
5) Run Draft.Rmd to produce the PDF.
