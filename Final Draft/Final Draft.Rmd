abstract: |
  What led to Donald Trump's surprising 2016 election victory? This paper examines the potential contribution of deindustrialization. Counties differ by exposure to manufacturing, which we use in an instrumental-variable approach to identify the effect of manufacturing job loss on change in Democratic vote share. We find that Democratic vote share falls in counties with high manufacturing job loss since 2004. Disaggregating this result by race shows that the Democratic vote share fell where layoffs affected white populations, and rose where layoffs affected nonwhites. This suggests a racial component to how voters process economic hardship.

Sample figure:












American Economic Review Pointers:

\begin{itemize}
\item Do not use an "Introduction" heading. Begin your introductory material
before the first section heading.

\item Avoid style markup (except sparingly for emphasis).

\item Avoid using explicit vertical or horizontal space.

\item Captions are short and go below figures but above tables.

\item The tablenotes or figurenotes environments may be used below tables
or figures, respectively, as demonstrated below.

\item If you have difficulties with the mathtime package, adjust the package
options appropriately for your platform. If you can't get it to work, just
remove the package or see our technical support document online (please
refer to the author instructions).

\item If you are using an appendix, it goes last, after the bibliography.
Use regular section headings to make the appendix headings.

\item If you are not using an appendix, you may delete the appendix command
and sample appendix section heading.

\item Either the natbib package or the harvard package may be used with bibtex.
To include one of these packages, uncomment the appropriate usepackage command
above. Note: you can't use both packages at once or compile-time errors will result.

\end{itemize}
